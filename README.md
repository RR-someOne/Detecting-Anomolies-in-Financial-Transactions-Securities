# Detecting Anomolies in Financial Transactions & Securities 

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning models and scripts for detecting fraudulent transactions. The project focuses on a comprehensive approach to fraud detection, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. The goal is to provide a practical and scalable solution for identifying fraudulent activities in transactional datasets.

## Features
Multiple ML Models: Implements and compares various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Isolation Forest.

Data Imbalance Handling: Demonstrates techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, which are common in fraud detection (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling).

Feature Engineering: Includes scripts for creating new features from raw transactional data to improve model performance.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates model effectiveness using specialized metrics like Precision-Recall curves, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix, which are crucial for fraud detection.

Clear Code: The codebase is well-documented and organized into modular scripts for clarity and reusability.

## Getting Started
